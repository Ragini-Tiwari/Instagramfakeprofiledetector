Instagram Fake Profile Detector
This project aims to create a tool for detecting fake profiles on Instagram using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The detector is implemented in Python and hosted as a web application using Flask.

Purpose
With the rise of social media influence and online marketing, fake profiles have become a prevalent issue on platforms like Instagram. These fake profiles can engage in various malicious activities, including spreading misinformation, scamming users, and artificially inflating follower counts. This project seeks to address this issue by providing a tool to identify suspicious profiles.

Features
KNN Algorithm: Utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify profiles as either real or fake based on features extracted from profile data.

Web Interface: The detector is accessible via a web interface, allowing users to upload profile images for analysis.

Scalability: Designed to handle large volumes of profile data and provide quick analysis results.

Installation and Setup
To use the Instagram Fake Profile Detector, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary Python dependencies.
Train the KNN algorithm using labeled profile data.
Set up the Flask web application to host the detector.
Launch the application and access it through a web browser.
Usage
Upload Profile Image: Users can upload an Instagram profile image to the web interface.
Analysis: The detector analyzes the uploaded image and classifies the profile as either real or fake.
Display Results: The results of the analysis are displayed to the user, indicating whether the profile is deemed suspicious or not.
